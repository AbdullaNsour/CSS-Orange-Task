    <p>My dog sasha is my best friend she likes to chass When I was four years old I had a little dog
        named Benny.
        He was a faithful dog to our family. He used to take care of me when I was little. Mother always trusted
        Benny because he was never known to leave me or allow anyone to touch me.
        One day when I was in the house playing with my dolls, Benny was not with me. I knew that the back door was
        open and I could get outdoors without being seen. So I got my dolly all dressed up because I was going to
        take her too.

        take her too.
        I put my coat and hat on and started off. My dolly and I got outdoors and had started down the lane to the
        canal when I felt something p7ulling on my dress. I looked around and there was Benny. Oh, how angry I was.
        I slapped Benny but he knew I was doing wrong. He pulled me home. When I got home mother and my grandmother
        were looking for me. When they saw Benny pulling me they gave on scream and rant to me and Benny. Benny
        wagged his tail. Mother put me to bed, but she gave Benny a big piece of meat.
